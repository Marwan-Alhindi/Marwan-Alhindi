## View Your Brain as a Factory
The goal in life is to optimize your inputs to maximize your impact. While the input areas Iâ€™ve outlined may not capture the entire space of possibilitiesâ€”and circumstances naturally vary from person to personâ€”I believe this core principle holds true for everyone. To effectively manage this wide array of inputs, we all need a second brain systemâ€”one that combines both task management and knowledge organization.
